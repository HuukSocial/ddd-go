# DDD in Go
This repository is used to present how I find implementing DDD in Go projects works out

This is written and explained in my article [How To Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) inÂ Golang](https://programmingpercy.tech/blog/how-to-structure-ddd-in-go/)

Note that this branch does not match a clean architecture, 
in this branch I have named everything after the DDD term,  
the idea behind this repository is to learn the DDD patterns and components.  

In the [clean-architecture](https://github.com/percybolmer/ddd-go/tree/clean-architecture) branch we look at how to structure a more...clean structure looks like.
